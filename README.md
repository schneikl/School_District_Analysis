# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the impact of what is believed to be academit dishonesty at Thomas High School regarding grades for ninth graders in math and reading. By updating our analysis to remove these scores from our dataframes, we can compare our results to the prior results that included the scores in question. From there, we can make a determination if those 9th grade scores at Thomas High School drastically changed the school's performance.

## Results of PyCity Schools Analysis:
Following the analysis, we found the following results when comparing the metrics to the data that included the questionable grades:

* Total School Budget
    * No change observed or expected due to analysis (overall budget not impacted)
    
* Per Student Budget
    * No change observed or expected due to analysis (per student budget not impacted)

* Average Math Score
    * From 83.41 to 83.36. 
    
* Average Reading Score
    * From 83.89 to 83.84. 
    
* % Passing Math
    * From 93.27 to 93.18. 
    
* % Passing Reading
    * From 97.31 to 97.02. 
    
* % Passing Overall
    * From 90.95 to 90.63. .

## Summary of Results
After removing the questionable 9th grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School, while results changed, the changes themselves do not appear to represent true academic dishonesty at a braod scale. Overall, the Thomas High School analysis without the 9th graders included were in line with the results when 9th grade was included. That said, all scores with the 9th grade class included exceeded those without, with % Passing Overall and % Passing Reading having the greatest difference, followed by % passing math with Average scores having similar changes for both subjects. Ultimately, while it does appear there may have been academic dishonesty, the results seem to support a potential smaller subset of students with grades that may have been adjusted, and likely not the entire 9th grade.
